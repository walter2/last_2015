Using Django 1.9 and Python 3.4.

All code from the [DjangoGirls blog tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html).

The site allows to create and manage blog posts. Comments can be added and the blog owner can accept or decline the posts before showing them on the site. Multiple users can be post creators and managers.

Minor changes were done for the deployment at pythonanywhere.com.
